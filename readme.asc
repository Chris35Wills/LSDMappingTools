These are some plotting tools for working with geospatial data in python. 

The package is in the folder *LSDPlottingTools*. You can use by downloading this folder and including the package with:

[source,python]
----
import LSDPlottingTools as LSDPT
----

At some point in the future we will include a setup.py routine. 

These scripts are in the development stage!!
