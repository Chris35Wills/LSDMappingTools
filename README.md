# LSDMapArtist
An experimental python package for plotting LSDTopoTools output and world domination. (But mainly plotting)


An object-oriented plotting module for constructing
drape maps in a reusable, generic way.

Experimental. Use at your own risk.

If it ever works I'll transfer it to @LSDTopoTools
